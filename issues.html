      <h1 class="issuesh">Housing</h1>
      <p class="issuesp">The housing affordability crisis has been a top priority for me throughout my tenure on the Council.

        <h1 class="issuesh">Fiscal Responsibility</h1>
        <p class="issuesp">I am proud to have led efforts to significantly bolster our financial reserves. We increased the city’s rainy-day fund to 20% of the general fund, the largest reserve in our history. Additionally, I spearheaded the creation of 9 new reserve funds, including allocations for critical areas such as the Conference Center, Sports Center Facilities, Technology Infrastructure, Sea Level Rise, City Facilities, Library Facility and Maintenance, and Public Safety Facility and Maintenance. </p>
