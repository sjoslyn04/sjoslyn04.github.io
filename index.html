      <h1>My Story</h1>

    <section class="s1">
      <p class="p2">Like many young people in Monterey, I grew up in a military family. My mom served in the Navy for 20
        years so
        we moved around the world and never lived anywhere long enough to grow roots. The central role the military
        played in our lives was a formative experience, but also an isolating one. That feeling of isolation led me to
        seek long-term connections and community in beautiful Monterey, where I have been honored to serve as a city
        councilmember since 2018, and as mayor since 2022.</p>

      <div class="obama-text-container">
        <p class="p3">I have a proven track record of bringing people of diverse backgrounds together to accomplish
          common goals. As
          a Deputy Regional Field Director for President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign, I was proud to manage a
          team
          of over 500 staff and volunteers in the President’s successful campaign.</p>
        <p class="p4">Since 2022, I served on the board of the Community Foundation for Monterey County (CFMC), chairing
          the
          Community Impact Investment Committee. Through our work, CFMC inspires philanthropy and bolstering communities
          across Monterey County, with significant grants totaling <b>$41 million</b> in 2023.</p>

        <p class="p5">We are living through a pivotal moment for our region. There are critical decisions that elected
          officials must
          make in the coming years that will impact the long-term sustainability of our community. Through my previous
          experience as a committee member on the Architectural Review Committee, and previous Chair of the Monterey
          County Housing Advisory Committee, I have seen firsthand the difference an active community makes. I have
          fought
          for public control of our utilities, including our water and energy supply, but efforts by a few can only go
          so
          far - <b>change requires persistent and sustained efforts of an engaged community.</b> </p>

        <p class="p6">As Monterey’s Mayor, I will continue working tirelessly to foster, grow, and encourage productive
          civic
          participation. I envision a future for our city as a leader in public engagement. By better utilizing modern
          forms of communication, I believe we can <strong>“Move Monterey Forward”</strong> by fostering robust
          community
          input to drive decision making in our local government.</p>
